To analyze the input code and output the documentation in Markdown (MD) format, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Code Language**: Determine the programming language of the input code. This is crucial for understanding the syntax and semantics of the code.

2. **Extract Key Components**: Break down the code into its main components such as functions, classes, variables, and control structures. This will help in documenting each part effectively.

3. **Document the Code**: For each component identified, write a clear and concise description in Markdown format. Include:
   - **Functionality**: What the component does.
   - **Parameters**: Any inputs the component requires.
   - **Returns**: What the component outputs.
   - **Usage**: How to use the component within the application.

4. **Create Installation Instructions**: Write step-by-step instructions on how to install any necessary software or libraries required to run the code. This should include:
   - **Software Requirements**: List all the software and their versions needed.
   - **Installation Commands**: Provide commands or links to install the required software.
   - **Configuration Steps**: Detail any configuration steps needed after installation.

5. **Configure Environment**: Explain how to set up the environment to run the application. This includes:
   - **Environment Setup**: Instructions on setting up the development environment.
   - **Running the Application**: Steps to compile and run the application.
   - **Testing**: How to test the application to ensure it works as expected.

6. **Final Review**: Review the documentation for clarity and completeness. Ensure that a user can understand and follow the documentation to successfully run the application.

### Example Markdown Documentation

```markdown
# Application Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a detailed overview of the application, including installation, configuration, and usage instructions.

## Software Requirements
- Language: Python 3.8+
- Libraries: numpy, pandas

## Installation
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

## Environment Setup
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

## Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Testing
To ensure the application works correctly, run the test suite:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## Code Components

### Function: `process_data`
- **Functionality**: Processes the input data and returns the processed output.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `data`: Input data as a list.
- **Returns**: Processed data as a list.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  result = process_data([1, 2, 3])
  ```

### Class: `DataProcessor`
- **Functionality**: A class for handling data processing tasks.
- **Methods**:
  - `load_data`: Loads data from a file.
  - `save_data`: Saves processed data to a file.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  processor = DataProcessor()
  processor.load_data('input.txt')
  processor.save_data('output.txt')
  ```

## Conclusion
This documentation should provide all the necessary information to install, configure, and run the application successfully.
