## Introduction to the Tic Tac Toe App
This app provides a simple implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe with a leaderboard feature. The game is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and utilizes a SQLite database to store player information and game results.

## Prerequisites
To run the app, you will need to have Python and pip installed on your system. You will also need to install the required dependencies, including Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

## Installing Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy
```
## Configuring the Environment
To configure the environment, create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal. Create a new file called `app.py` and paste the provided Python code into it. Create a new file called `index.html` and paste the provided HTML code into it.

## Running the App
To run the app, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
This will start the Flask development server, and you can access the app by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Using the App
To use the app, simply click on the cells to make moves. The game will automatically detect when a player has won or when the game is a tie. The leaderboard will be updated accordingly, and you can view it by refreshing the page or by clicking on the "Leaderboard" link.

## API Endpoints
The app provides several API endpoints for interacting with the game data:

* `/api/leaderboard`: Returns the current leaderboard data in JSON format.
* `/api/player`: Creates a new player with the provided name.
* `/api/game_result`: Saves the result of a game, including the winner and loser.

## Example Use Cases
Here are some example use cases for the API endpoints:

* To retrieve the current leaderboard data, send a GET request to `/api/leaderboard`.
* To create a new player, send a POST request to `/api/player` with the player name in the request body.
* To save the result of a game, send a POST request to `/api/game_result` with the game result data in the request body.

## Code Documentation
The code is documented with comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and behavior of each section. The Python code uses Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy to define the app and interact with the database. The HTML code uses JavaScript to handle user input and update the game state.

### Database Schema
The database schema is defined using Flask-SQLAlchemy and consists of a single table called `players`. The `players` table has the following columns:

* `id`: A unique integer identifier for each player.
* `name`: The name of the player.
* `wins`: The number of games won by the player.
* `losses`: The number of games lost by the player.
* `ties`: The number of games tied by the player.

### Game Logic
The game logic is implemented in the `saveGameResult` function, which updates the game state and saves the result to the database. The game logic is also implemented in the `checkWinner` function, which checks if a player has won the game.

### Leaderboard Update
The leaderboard is updated automatically when a game is saved or when the page is refreshed. The leaderboard data is retrieved from the database and displayed on the page.

### Error Handling
Error handling is implemented using try-except blocks to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code. The error messages are displayed on the page to inform the user of any errors that may have occurred.
