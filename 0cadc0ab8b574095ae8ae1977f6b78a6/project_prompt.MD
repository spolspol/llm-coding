## Instructions for Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game

### Project Overview
Create a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other in a browser. The game will feature a simple user interface, player turn management, win detection, and the option to restart the game.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Framework**: Optional - Consider using React for state management, or Vanilla JS for simplicity.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the game is playable on mobile and desktop devices.

### Architecture Pattern
Use the **Component-Based Architecture**:
- Each part of the UI will be a separate component.
- Components will be reusable and maintainable.

### Code Design Outline
1. **App Component**
   - Main container for the game.
   - Handles game state and logic.

2. **Board Component**
   - Represents the game board (3x3 grid).
   - Renders individual square components.

3. **Square Component**
   - Represents a single square on the board.
   - Displays the player's symbol (X or O).

4. **Status Component**
   - Displays the current status of the game (whose turn is it, or who won).

5. **Restart Button**
   - Allows players to reset the game.

### Functional Components Breakdown

1. **App Component**
   - **State Management**: Create necessary states for tracking the board data (array of squares), current player, game status (win/lose/draw), and moves count.
   - **Functions**:
     - `handleSquareClick(index)`: Updates the board state when a square is clicked.
     - `checkWinCondition()`: Determines if there's a winner after each move.
     - `restartGame()`: Resets the game state to initial values.

2. **Board Component**
   - **Props**: Pass down the current board state and click handler.
   - **Render**: Create 3x3 grid by mapping over the squares array and rendering the `Square` components.

3. **Square Component**
   - **Props**: Accepts square value (X/O) and click handler.
   - **Render**: Display the correct symbol based on the state passed as props.
   - **Logic**: Add click event that triggers the click handler for the corresponding square.

4. **Status Component**
   - **Props**: Takes the game status and current player.
   - **Render**: Display messages based on the game state (e.g., "X's turn", "O's turn", "X wins!", etc.).

5. **Restart Button**
   - **Functionality**: Call `restartGame()` from App component when clicked.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Project**
   - Initialize a new web project (e.g., using Create React App or set up a simple HTML/CSS/JS structure).
   - Organize project directory (e.g., `/src/components`, `/src/styles`, `/src/assets`).

2. **Create Components**
   - Build the `App`, `Board`, `Square`, `Status`, and `RestartButton` components as outlined.
   - Develop each component iteratively by first focusing on the structure and gradually adding functionality.

3. **State Management**
   - In the `App` component, implement state management using React hooks (e.g., `useState`).
   - Pass down necessary states and handlers to child components through props.

4. **Game Logic**
   - Implement the `handleSquareClick` and `checkWinCondition` functions in the `App` component to handle game rules.
   - Ensure that the win detection covers all required conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

5. **Styling**
   - Use CSS to make the game visually appealing and responsive.
   - Consider adding hover effects for squares and styling for winning paths or draws.

6. **Testing**
   - Test the game functionality thoroughly, ensuring all scenarios (winning, drawing, restarts) work as expected.
   - Make sure the UI responds well to different screen sizes.

7. **Deployment**
   - Choose a deployment platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).
   - Follow the deployment instructions to host the Tic-Tac-Toe web game online.

### Additional Features (Optional)
- Add sound effects for player moves and win announcements.
- Allow players to play against an AI opponent for a more challenging experience.
- Implement user profiles and scoreboard functionality to track wins.

### Final Notes
- Ensure that the code is clean, well-organized, and adheres to best practices.
- Comment on significant sections of your code for readability and maintainability.
- Document any known issues or future improvements that could enhance the game.
