Here is a complete set of instructions for building a Python script to manage Kubernetes pod deployments:

**I. Project Setup**

1. Create a new directory for the project.
2. Initialize a Git repository in the project directory using `git init`.
3. Create a virtual environment for the project using `python -m venv env`.
4. Activate the virtual environment.

**II. Dependency Management**

1. Install the required dependencies:
	* `kubernetes` library: `pip install kubernetes`
	* `json` library: `pip install json`
2. Verify that the libraries are installed by running `pip list`.

**III. Script Structure**

1. Create a new Python file in the project directory, e.g., `deployment_manager.py`.
2. Define a main function to serve as the entry point for the script.
3. Organize the code into logical sections:
	* Import statements
	* Configuration section (e.g., API endpoint, credentials)
	* Pod deployment management functions
	* Error handling

**IV. Pod Deployment Management**

1. Implement functions to manage pod deployments:
	* `create_pod`: create a new pod with a specified name and configuration.
	* `update_pod`: update an existing pod's configuration.
	* `delete_pod`: delete a pod.
2. Use the `kubernetes` library to interact with the Kubernetes API.

**V. Error Handling**

1. Implement error handling for common scenarios:
	* Pod creation/deletion errors
	* Configuration errors (e.g., invalid credentials)
2. Log errors using a logging library (e.g., `logging`) and provide informative error messages.

**VI. Documentation**

1. Create a Markdown file in the project directory, e.g., `README.md`.
2. Document the script's functionality, usage, and limitations.
3. Include examples of how to use the script.

**VII. Testing**

1. Write unit tests for individual functions using a testing library (e.g., `unittest`).
2. Test the script with sample input data to ensure correct behavior.

**VIII. Deployment**

1. Package the script and dependencies into a distributable format (e.g., `.zip`, `.tar.gz`).
2. Deploy the script to a suitable environment (e.g., cloud, on-premises).

By following these instructions, you should be able to create a Python script that effectively manages Kubernetes pod deployments. - prompt
