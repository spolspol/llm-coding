### Overview
The provided Python script utilizes the Kubernetes Python client library to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. It allows users to deploy new pods, delete existing pods, view pod details, scale deployments, and watch pod status changes.

### Key Features
* Deploying new pods from YAML files
* Deleting existing pods by name or label
* Viewing pod details, including name, status, IP, and node name
* Scaling deployments to a specified number of replicas
* Watching pod status changes

### Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Kubernetes Python client library (`kubernetes`)
* YAML library (`yaml`)
* A Kubernetes cluster (local or managed)

### Installation
To use this script, install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install kubernetes yaml
```
You will also need to have a Kubernetes cluster set up and configured, with the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable pointing to your `kubeconfig` file.

### Usage
The script provides several functions for interacting with your Kubernetes cluster:
* `create_pod_from_yaml(yaml_file)`: Deploy a new pod from a YAML file.
* `delete_pod(name, label_selector=None)`: Delete a pod by name or label.
* `view_pod_details(name)`: View details of a pod.
* `scale_deployment(name, replicas)`: Scale a deployment to a specified number of replicas.
* `watch_pod_status(name)`: Watch pod status changes.

Example usage:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_pod_from_yaml("pod.yaml")
    delete_pod("my-pod")
    view_pod_details("my-pod")
    scale_deployment("my-deployment", 3)
    watch_pod_status("my-pod")
```
### Configuration
The script uses the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to locate your `kubeconfig` file. You can set this variable manually or use the `load_kube_config()` function to load the configuration from the default location.

### Troubleshooting
Common issues include:
* `ConfigException`: The `kubeconfig` file cannot be found or is invalid.
* `ApiException`: The Kubernetes API returns an error. Check the error message for more information.

### Future Development
Planned features include:
* Expanding support for Kubernetes resources (e.g., services, persistent volumes)
* Adding security features (e.g., authentication, authorization)
* Improving error handling and logging

### API Documentation
The script uses the Kubernetes Python client library, which provides a comprehensive API for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. For more information, see the [Kubernetes Python client library documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python).
