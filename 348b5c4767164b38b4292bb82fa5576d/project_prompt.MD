Here is a set of instructions for building a complete software project to manage Kubernetes deployments and pods:

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive tool for managing Kubernetes deployments and pods. This includes the ability to deploy new pods, delete existing ones, and view detailed information about each pod.

**Step 1: Define Project Requirements**

* Identify the key features required for the project:
	+ Deploying new pods
	+ Deleting existing pods
	+ Viewing detailed information about each pod (e.g. status, logs)
* Determine the target Kubernetes environment (e.g. local cluster, cloud provider)

**Step 2: Design the Architecture**

* Decide on the programming language and framework to use for the project (e.g. Python, Go, Java)
* Choose a library or tool for interacting with the Kubernetes API (e.g. kubernetes-python, go-k8s)
* Determine the data structures and storage mechanisms needed for storing pod information

**Step 3: Implement Core Functionality**

* Write code to deploy new pods using the chosen programming language and framework
* Implement functionality for deleting existing pods
* Develop a system for viewing detailed information about each pod (e.g. status, logs)

**Step 4: Add Additional Features**

* Consider adding features such as:
	+ Pod scaling (i.e. increasing or decreasing the number of replicas)
	+ Watching for changes to pod status and updating accordingly
	+ Support for multiple Kubernetes environments (e.g. local cluster, cloud provider)

**Step 5: Create Documentation**

* Write clear and concise documentation for each feature and function:
	+ Code comments and docstrings
	+ README file with project overview and usage instructions
	+ User manual or guide for using the tool

**Step 6: Test and Debug**

* Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure the code works as expected
* Perform functional testing to verify that the tool meets the requirements:
	+ Deploying, deleting, and viewing pods
	+ Handling edge cases (e.g. errors, unexpected behavior)

**Step 7: Package and Distribute**

* Package the project into a distributable format (e.g. wheel, tarball)
* Create installation instructions for end-users:
	+ Installation scripts or packages
	+ Configuration files and settings

**Step 8: Maintain and Update**

* Regularly update the tool to ensure compatibility with changing Kubernetes versions and features
* Monitor user feedback and bug reports to identify areas for improvement
* Plan for future development and expansion of the project
