### Instructions for Building a Battleship Web Game

#### 1. Project Setup
- **Initialize the Project:**
  - Create a new directory for the project.
  - Set up version control (e.g., Git).
  - Initialize a package manager (e.g., npm or yarn).

- **Choose Technology Stack:**
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)
  - Backend: Node.js with Express.js
  - Database: None (in-memory storage for simplicity)

#### 2. Code Architecture Pattern
- **Frontend:**
  - Use React.js for building the user interface.
  - Follow a component-based architecture.
  - Implement state management using React's Context API or Redux.

- **Backend:**
  - Use Express.js to create RESTful APIs.
  - Implement game logic and player management.

#### 3. Functional Components

##### Frontend Components
1. **GameBoard Component**
   - Display the game grid for both players.
   - Handle user interactions (e.g., placing ships, attacking).

2. **ShipPlacement Component**
   - Allow users to place their ships on the board.
   - Validate ship placement rules.

3. **GameStatus Component**
   - Display the current status of the game (e.g., whose turn it is, winner announcement).
   - Show messages and notifications.

4. **PlayerComponent**
   - Manage player information and actions.
   - Handle player turns and interactions.

5. **MainMenu Component**
   - Provide options to start a new game or join an existing one.
   - Display instructions and rules.

##### Backend Components
1. **GameLogic Module**
   - Implement the core game logic (e.g., ship placement, attack validation).
   - Manage game state and transitions.

2. **PlayerModule**
   - Handle player registration and authentication.
   - Manage player data and interactions.

3. **GameManager Module**
   - Create and manage game instances.
   - Coordinate game flow between players.

4. **API Routes**
   - Define RESTful endpoints for game actions (e.g., place ship, attack, get game status).

#### 4. Implementation Steps

##### Frontend Implementation
1. **Set Up React Project:**
   - Create a new React application using `create-react-app`.
   - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., axios for API calls).

2. **Create Components:**
   - Develop the `GameBoard`, `ShipPlacement`, `GameStatus`, and `PlayerComponent` components.
   - Implement state management to handle game data.

3. **Implement Game Logic:**
   - Integrate game logic into the components.
   - Handle user interactions and update the game state accordingly.

4. **Style the Application:**
   - Use CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) to style the components.
   - Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.

5. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for individual components using Jest and React Testing Library.
   - Perform end-to-end testing using tools like Cypress.

##### Backend Implementation
1. **Set Up Express Project:**
   - Create a new Node.js project.
   - Initialize an Express server.

2. **Develop Modules:**
   - Implement the `GameLogic`, `PlayerModule`, and `GameManager` modules.
   - Define game rules, player actions, and state management.

3. **Create API Routes:**
   - Set up RESTful endpoints for game actions (e.g., POST /place-ship, POST /attack).
   - Handle requests and responses to/from the frontend.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for individual modules using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure API endpoints work correctly.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the backend on a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
   - Deploy the frontend on a static file hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

#### 5. Final Integration
- **Connect Frontend and Backend:**
  - Ensure the frontend communicates with the backend via API calls.
  - Test the integrated application to ensure all features work as expected.

- **Optimize Performance:**
  - Optimize both frontend and backend for performance.
  - Implement caching strategies if necessary.

- **Documentation:**
  - Document the codebase, including setup instructions, API endpoints, and usage guidelines.
