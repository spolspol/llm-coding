# Application Overview

This C++ application is designed to read factory data from a specified file, compare it with configuration data derived from JSON files, and then update hardware functions based on the comparison. The application uses several structures to organize the data, including `DeviceInfo`, `DeviceConfig`, `ConfigData`, `FactoryData`, and `JSONenv`.

## Structures and Functions

### Structures

- **DeviceInfo**: Contains `deviceID` and `DeviceConfigFile`.
- **DeviceConfig**: Contains device-specific information like `serialNumber`, `firmwareVersion`, `hardwareVersion`, `manufacturer`, and vectors for `supportedFunctionalities`, `availableFunctionalities`, and `softwareFunctions`.
- **ConfigData**: Contains a `configName` and a vector of `DeviceConfig` objects.
- **FactoryData**: Contains a vector of `DeviceInfo` objects.
- **JSONenv**: Contains a vector of `jsonFiles` and a `fileName`.

### Functions

- **readFactoryData**: Reads factory data from a specified file and populates the `FactoryData` structure.
- **compareData**: Compares the `FactoryData` with `ConfigData`.
- **doSomething**: Placeholder function that needs to be replaced with the actual logic to update hardware functions.

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. GCC or Clang are recommended.
- **C++ Standard Library**: The code uses standard C++ libraries, so make sure your environment supports C++11 or later.
- **JSON Library**: Although not directly included in the code, you will need a JSON parsing library to read JSON files. `nlohmann/json` is a popular choice.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install C++ Compiler**:
   - On Ubuntu/Debian:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install g++
     ```
   - On macOS with Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install gcc
     ```

2. **Install JSON Library**:
   - Clone the `nlohmann/json` repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
     ```
   - Include the `json.hpp` file in your project directory.

### Configuration

1. **Set Up Project Directory**:
   - Create a directory for your project and navigate into it:
     ```bash
     mkdir my_cpp_project
     cd my_cpp_project
     ```

2. **Add Source Files**:
   - Create a `main.cpp` file and paste the provided code into it.
   - Add the `json.hpp` file from the `nlohmann/json` library to your project directory.

3. **Modify JSONenv and JSON Parsing**:
   - Update the `JSONenv` structure and the JSON parsing logic in the `main` function to correctly read and parse JSON files using the `nlohmann/json` library.

### Running the Application

1. **Compile the Code**:
   - Use the following command to compile the code:
     ```bash
     g++ -std=c++11 -o my_app main.cpp
     ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the compiled binary:
     ```bash
     ./my_app
     ```

### Notes

- Ensure that the `FactoryData.txt` file and the JSON files are correctly formatted and placed in the appropriate directory.
- The `compareData` and `doSomething` functions need to be implemented with the specific logic required for your application.
- Consider adding error handling and logging to improve the robustness of the application.
