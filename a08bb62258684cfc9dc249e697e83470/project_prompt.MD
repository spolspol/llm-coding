TDM is a classic two-player strategic game where players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with their respective marks, X or O. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

The project you describe sounds like a great candidate for using Python's tkinter library for building the graphical user interface (GUI) and a framework such as Django or Flask for handling the backend logic and database functionality. Here are some high-level instructions for creating this application:

1. Set up your development environment: Install Python 3.x and its dependencies, including tkinter, Django or Flask, and a database management system (such as SQLite).
2. Design the code architecture: Decide on the overall structure of your project, including how different components will interact with each other. For example, you might create separate models for users, games, and game moves.
3. Create the database schema: Use your chosen database management system to create tables for storing user information, game data, and move history.
4. Build the GUI: Implement the tkinter interface using Python and design the layout of your game board, buttons, and other elements.
5. Write the backend logic: Implement Django or Flask views and routes to handle requests from the frontend and interact with the database. This will include handling user registration/authentication, game setup/management, move validation, and the leaderboard functionality.
6. Test and debug your application: Thoroughly test your application at each stage of development to ensure that it is functioning correctly and fix any issues as they arise.

These are just some high-level instructions for getting started on this project. For a more detailed and structured set of instructions, you may want to break down the tasks into smaller steps and provide further information on specific aspects of the code design and implementation.
