### Tic Tac Toe Game Documentation
#### Overview
This is a simple implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and SQLite for storing game data. The game allows two players, 'X' and 'O', to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid.

#### Installation and Configuration
To run the game, you will need to have Python and the Tkinter library installed on your system. You will also need to install the pysqlite3 library, which is a Python extension that provides a SQL database engine.

*   **Python Installation:**
    *   For Windows, download the latest version of Python from the official Python website and follow the installation instructions.
    *   For macOS (with Homebrew), run `brew install python` in your terminal.
    *   For Linux, run `sudo apt-get install python3` (for Ubuntu-based systems) or `sudo yum install python3` (for RPM-based systems).
*   **Tkinter Installation:**
    *   Tkinter comes bundled with most Python installations, but if it's not included, you can install it separately:
        *   For Windows, you can download the Tkinter installer from the official Python website.
        *   For macOS (with Homebrew), run `brew install python-tk` in your terminal.
        *   For Linux, run `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` (for Ubuntu-based systems) or `sudo yum install python3-tkinter` (for RPM-based systems).
*   **pysqlite3 Installation:**
    *   You can install pysqlite3 using pip: `pip install pysqlite3`
*   **Running the Game:**
    1.  Save the game code in a file named `tic_tac_toe.py`.
    2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
    3.  Run the game by typing `python tic_tac_toe.py` and pressing Enter.

#### Game Logic
The game logic is implemented in the `TicTacToe` class, which handles the game state, player moves, and winning conditions. The game state is stored in a SQLite database, which is created when the game is first run.

#### Database Schema
The game uses three tables in the SQLite database:

*   **users:** Stores information about the players, including their unique IDs and usernames.
*   **games:** Stores information about each game, including the IDs of the players, the game state, and the game ID.
*   **moves:** Stores the moves made by each player during a game, including the game ID, player ID, and move details.

#### Game Interface
The game interface is implemented using Tkinter, which provides a simple and intuitive way to create graphical user interfaces in Python. The game grid is displayed as a 3x3 matrix of buttons, and the current player's turn is displayed at the bottom of the window.

#### Game Flow
Here's an overview of the game flow:

1.  The game starts with an empty grid and player 'X' as the current player.
2.  When a player clicks on an empty cell, their mark ('X' or 'O') is displayed in the cell.
3.  The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player has won, the game ends and the winner is announced.
4.  If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
5.  Players can restart the game by closing the game window and running the game again.
