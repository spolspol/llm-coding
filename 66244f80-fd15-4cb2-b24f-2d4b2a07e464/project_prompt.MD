### Instructions to Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python Using HTTP Sockets and a Web Page

#### Project Overview
Create a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can play against each other over HTTP sockets. The game will consist of a backend implemented in Python using HTTP sockets to handle requests and a frontend HTML/JavaScript interface to display the game.

#### Software Architecture
1. **Architecture Pattern:** Use a client-server architecture.
2. **Components:**
   - **Server**: A Python HTTP Server handling game logic and player interactions.
   - **Client**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend to render the game board and handle user interactions.

### Code Design Outline

#### 1. Set Up the Project Structure
- Create a project directory:
  - `tic_tac_toe/`
    - `server.py`      (Python HTTP server)
    - `static/`        (Directory for static files)
      - `index.html`   (HTML file for the game frontend)
      - `style.css`    (CSS file for styling)
      - `script.js`     (JavaScript file for client-side logic)

#### 2. Implement the Server Logic (`server.py`)
- **Dependencies**: Use Python's built-in `http.server` library.
- **Components**:
  - **Game State Management**: Create a class to manage the game state (board, current player, etc.).
  - **HTTP Request Handler**: Implement a request handler to manage GET (serve HTML) and POST (update game state) requests.
  
##### Steps:
1. Initialize server and import necessary libraries.
2. Define the `Game` class:
   - Attributes: board state, current player, methods to reset game, check for winner, make moves.
3. Define the `RequestHandler` class:
   - Handle GET requests to serve `index.html`.
   - Handle POST requests to update game state and return the new board state as JSON.
4. Start the server on a chosen port.

#### 3. Create the Frontend (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)
- **HTML**: Build a simple grid layout for the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
  - Include a reset button and display area for game messages.
  
##### Steps:
1. Create an HTML structure with a grid (3x3) for the game board.
2. Add a reset button for starting a new game.
3. Link `style.css` for styling and `script.js` for interactivity.

- **CSS**: Style the board and game UI to make it visually appealing.
  
##### Steps:
1. Style the game board cells to be uniform in size, center-align text, and add hover effects.
2. Style the reset button and messages for clarity.

- **JavaScript**: Handle user interactions and communicate with the backend.
  
##### Steps:
1. Wait for player clicks on the grid and send the move to the server using `fetch()`.
2. Update the game board based on server responses.
3. Manage game state on the client-side, including displaying messages based on game results.
4. Handle the reset button to reload the game state.

#### 4. Testing
- Create test cases to ensure:
  - Proper handling of game states (valid moves, wins, ties).
  - Server can handle multiple concurrent connections.
  - The frontend correctly updates based on the serverâ€™s responses.

#### 5. Deployment
- Choose a deployment option:
  - Local server for development/testing.
  - Consider platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean for remote hosting if desired.

Ensure to include a README file to provide details on how to run the server, access the game through the browser, and any additional instructions for players.

### Summary Outline of Implementation
1. Set up project structure.
2. Implement server in `server.py`:
   - Game class for managing state.
   - HTTP request handler for serving pages and handling moves.
3. Create frontend files:
   - `index.html` for layout.
   - `style.css` for styling.
   - `script.js` for interactivity.
4. Test the entire application.
5. Deploy the application for access.
