## Overview of the Code
The provided code is a simple game application built with Python and the Tkinter library. The game displays a window with a label showing the player's current score, a button to increase the score, and a button to view the leaderboard.

### Code Explanation

* The game has a target score of 10, and the player's score increases by a random amount between 1 and 3 each time the "Click Me!" button is clicked.
* When the player reaches the target score, a game over message is displayed, and the score is reset to 0.
* The leaderboard displays all scores achieved by the player in descending order.

### Technical Details

* The game uses the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
* The `random` library is used to generate random score increments.
* The game's logic is encapsulated within the `Game` class, which inherits from `tk.Tk`.

## Installation and Configuration
To run the game application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website.
2. **Install Tkinter**: Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is usually bundled with Python, but you can also install it separately if needed.
3. **Save the Code**: Save the provided code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `game.py`.
4. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `game.py` file. Run the application by executing the command `python game.py`.

## Running the Application
When you run the application, a window will appear with the game interface. You can interact with the game by clicking the "Click Me!" button to increase your score and the "View Leaderboard" button to view your achieved scores.

### Example Use Case
To test the game, follow these steps:

1. Run the application by executing `python game.py`.
2. Click the "Click Me!" button several times to increase your score.
3. When you reach the target score of 10, a game over message will be displayed.
4. Click the "View Leaderboard" button to view your achieved scores.

Note: The game will continue to run until you manually close the window.
