### Instructions for Building Reddit Clone Data Fetcher and MongoDB Storage

#### 1. Project Setup
- **Create a new Python project directory.**
- **Initialize a virtual environment:**
  - `python -m venv env`
  - `source env/bin/activate` (on Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`)
- **Install required dependencies:**
  - Selenium, Pymongo, Requests

#### 2. Code Design and Architecture
The project will follow a modular design with the following components:
1. **Configuration Manager:** Handles loading and validating configuration parameters.
2. **WebDriver Manager:** Manages Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
3. **MongoDB Manager:** Manages MongoDB connections and data storage.
4. **Data Fetcher:** Fetches posts and comments from the Reddit clone.
5. **Error Handler:** Handles errors gracefully during the fetching process.
6. **Main Script:** Orchestrates the overall flow of the application.

#### 3. Detailed Specification and Steps

##### 3.1 Configuration Manager
- **Specification:**
  - Load configuration parameters from a JSON file.
  - Validate configuration against a predefined JSON schema.
  - Provide command-line argument parsing for dynamic configuration.

- **Steps:**
  1. Define a JSON schema for the configuration file.
  2. Implement a function to load and validate the configuration file using `json` and `jsonschema`.
  3. Use `argparse` to parse command-line arguments for the configuration file path.

##### 3.2 WebDriver Manager
- **Specification:**
  - Initialize Selenium WebDriver with Chrome options.
  - Automate the login process on the Reddit clone.
  - Handle login errors and retries.

- **Steps:**
  1. Set up Chrome options to simulate a Chromebook browser.
  2. Implement functions to navigate to the login page, enter credentials, and submit the form.
  3. Add error handling for login failures and network issues.
  4. Wait for successful login by checking for redirection to the homepage.

##### 3.3 MongoDB Manager
- **Specification:**
  - Establish a connection to the MongoDB database.
  - Create collections for posts and comments.
  - Store fetched data in the respective collections.

- **Steps:**
  1. Initialize a MongoDB client using `pymongo`.
  2. Create 'my_posts' and 'my_comments' collections.
  3. Implement functions to insert data into these collections.

##### 3.4 Data Fetcher
- **Specification:**
  - Fetch posts and comments from the Reddit clone using the `requests` library.
  - Simulate different browser headers for each request.
  - Handle errors during the fetching process.

- **Steps:**
  1. Initialize a list of browser headers to simulate different devices.
  2. Implement functions to fetch posts and comments with appropriate headers and delays between requests.
  3. Store fetched data in respective MongoDB collections using the MongoDB Manager.

##### 3.5 Error Handler
- **Specification:**
  - Handle network issues, login failures, and other potential exceptions gracefully.
  - Provide meaningful error messages and retry mechanisms where applicable.

- **Steps:**
  1. Implement try-except blocks around critical sections of the code.
  2. Define custom exception classes for specific errors (e.g., LoginError, NetworkError).
  3. Add logging to capture error details for debugging purposes.

##### 3.6 Main Script
- **Specification:**
  - Orchestrate the overall flow of the application.
  - Coordinate between Configuration Manager, WebDriver Manager, MongoDB Manager, Data Fetcher, and Error Handler.

- **Steps:**
  1. Parse command-line arguments to get the configuration file path.
  2. Load and validate the configuration using the Configuration Manager.
  3. Initialize the WebDriver Manager for browser automation.
  4. Set up MongoDB connections using the MongoDB Manager.
  5. Fetch posts and comments using the Data Fetcher.
  6. Handle errors using the Error Handler.
  7. Close WebDriver and MongoDB connections gracefully.

#### 4. Additional Considerations
- **Configuration File:**
  - Allow specifying different Reddit clone URLs, number of requests per header, delay between requests, and other parameters through the configuration file or command-line arguments.
- **Logging:**
  - Implement logging to capture the flow of the application and any errors encountered.

#### 5. Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write unit tests for each component (Configuration Manager, WebDriver Manager, MongoDB Manager, Data Fetcher, Error Handler) using a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Write integration tests to ensure the overall flow of the application works as expected.

#### 6. Deployment
- **Packaging:**
  - Package the script into an executable format (e.g., using `pyinstaller`) for easy distribution.
- **Documentation:**
  - Provide clear documentation on how to use the script, including examples and configuration options.
