Here is a set of instructions for building a simple Sudoku web game:

**Step 1: Planning**

* Define the scope of the project: Create a simple Sudoku game that allows users to play and solve puzzles.
* Determine the features:
	+ Game board with 9x9 grid
	+ User input for numbers (1-9)
	+ Validity checking for inputs (e.g., no duplicate values in a row, column, or box)
	+ Hints system (optional)
* Plan the architecture: Front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side)

**Step 2: Front-end Development**

* Choose a front-end framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) and create a new project
* Design the game board component:
	+ Create a grid structure with 9x9 cells
	+ Implement user input handling for numbers (1-9)
	+ Add event listeners for cell clicks and key presses
* Implement the hint system (if chosen):
	+ Generate hints based on puzzle difficulty or user progress
	+ Display hints near the game board

**Step 3: Back-end Development**

* Choose a back-end framework (e.g., Node.js, Python) and create a new project
* Design the API for the front-end:
	+ Create endpoints for initializing the game, checking input validity, and providing hints
	+ Implement logic for generating puzzles, validating user inputs, and keeping track of game state
* Integrate with the front-end:
	+ Send puzzle data from the back-end to the front-end
	+ Receive user input and validate it on the back-end

**Step 4: Puzzle Generation**

* Design an algorithm for generating Sudoku puzzles:
	+ Randomly fill a grid with numbers (1-9) respecting the rules of Sudoku
	+ Remove some values to create a puzzle
* Implement the puzzle generation logic in the back-end:
	+ Create a function that generates a new puzzle based on difficulty level and user preferences

**Step 5: Testing and Debugging**

* Test the game thoroughly:
	+ Check for invalid input handling, hint system, and puzzle generation
	+ Verify that the game state is correctly updated after each move
* Fix any bugs or issues found during testing

**Step 6: Deployment**

* Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Heroku) and deploy the application
* Configure environment variables and settings as needed
* Test the deployed application to ensure it works correctly

**Step 7: Documentation and Maintenance**

* Write documentation for the game:
	+ Game rules and instructions
	+ Tips for playing Sudoku
	+ Troubleshooting guide
* Keep the game up-to-date by fixing bugs, adding new features, and maintaining compatibility with changing browser versions or technologies
