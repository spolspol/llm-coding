# Instructions to Build a Reddit Clone Data Fetcher and MongoDB Storage Script

## Project Overview
Develop a Python script that fetches posts and comments from a Reddit clone, storing them in MongoDB collections with metadata, using Selenium for automation.

### Architecture Pattern
Implement the script using the following architecture components:
- **Configuration Management**: Handle configuration using JSON schema and argparse for command line arguments.
- **Web Automation**: Use Selenium for logging into the Reddit clone.
- **Data Fetching**: Use Requests to fetch data while simulating different browser headers.
- **Data Storage**: Utilize Pymongo for interacting with MongoDB and storing posts and comments.
- **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks to gracefully manage errors and logging mechanisms.

### Functional Components Breakdown

1. **Library Imports**
   - Import the following libraries:
     - `selenium.webdriver`
     - `pymongo`
     - `requests`
     - `random`
     - `time`
     - `argparse`
     - `json`
     - `jsonschema`

2. **Command-Line Argument Parsing**
   - Use `argparse` to parse command-line arguments.
   - Add an argument for the configuration file path (e.g., `--config`).

3. **Configuration Loading**
   - Load configuration settings from the specified JSON configuration file.
   - Validate incoming data against predefined JSON schema to ensure data integrity.

4. **Selenium WebDriver Initialization**
   - Set up the Selenium Chrome webdriver with options to simulate a Chromebook environment.
   - Implement error handling for failed driver initialization.

5. **Login to Reddit Clone**
   - Navigate to the Reddit clone login page using the Selenium driver.
   - Input username and password, then submit the form.
   - Wait and verify successful login (e.g., check URL or presence of homepage elements).

6. **MongoDB Setup**
   - Initialize the MongoDB client with connection settings from the configuration file.
   - Create collections for storing posts and comments named `my_posts` and `my_comments`.

7. **Browser Header Management**
   - Define a list of various user-agent strings to simulate requests from different devices.
   - Implement a function to select and return a random user-agent from the list.

8. **Data Fetching Logic**
   - Create a loop that makes requests to fetch posts and comments based on provided URLs.
   - Implement time delays between requests to avoid being flagged as a bot.
   - Cycle through the list of browser headers for each request to simulate real user behavior.

9. **Data Storage in MongoDB**
   - Structure the fetched data into appropriate dictionaries for posts and comments.
   - Store data in respective MongoDB collections with error handling to catch insertion issues.

10. **Error Handling**
    - Implement comprehensive error handling for network errors, login failures, and data processing issues.
    - Log errors to the console or a log file for debugging purposes.

11. **Closing Resources**
    - After all data has been fetched, ensure the Selenium webdriver is closed properly.
    - Close the MongoDB client connection to release resources.

### Additional Implementation Notes
- Utilize the configuration file to specify:
  - Reddit clone URL
  - Number of requests per header
  - Delay duration (in seconds) between requests
- Follow Python coding standards (PEP 8) for readability and maintenance.
- Consider implementing a modular design by splitting the code into separate functions or classes for greater organization and testability. 

### Final Steps to Implement the Project
1. Set up a Python environment with necessary dependencies.
2. Create the structure of the script file (e.g., `reddit_clone_fetcher.py`).
3. Implement each functional component step-by-step, testing as you go.
4. Write a readme file with usage instructions and examples based on user inputs. 
5. Finally, run your script with sample configuration data to validate the implementation.
