 opponenet's ships are randomly placed on a 10x10 grid, and the player must guess which squares contain enemy ships and sink them with a limited number of guesses. The game is over when all enemy ships have been sunk or the player has run out of guesses. To win, the player must strategically use their guesses to determine the location of the enemy ships and avoid wasting shots on empty squares.
