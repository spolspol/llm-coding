Here is a set of instructions for LLM to follow to build a complete software project to test Kubernetes deployments:

**Project Title:** Kubernetes Deployment Tester

**Objective:** Create a Python script that tests Kubernetes deployments by verifying their status, scaling, and rolling updates.

**Instructions:**

I. Project Setup

1. Create a new directory for the project.
2. Initialize a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) using your preferred Python version.
3. Install the required libraries:
	* `kubectl` (Kubernetes command-line tool)
	* `pykube` (Python client library for Kubernetes)
	* `pytest` (testing framework)

II. Script Structure

1. Create a new Python file (`main.py`) to hold the script.
2. Define the following functions:
	* `create_deployment(name, replicas)`: creates a new Kubernetes deployment with the specified name and number of replicas
	* `get_deployment_status(deployment_name)`: retrieves the status of a deployment using kubectl
	* `scale_deployment(deployment_name, replicas)`: scales a deployment to the specified number of replicas using kubectl
	* `rollout_update(deployment_name, image)`: performs a rolling update on a deployment by updating its image using kubectl
	* `test_deployment(name)`: tests the status and scaling of a deployment

III. Testing

1. Write test cases for each function using pytest:
	* Test `create_deployment` with different names and replica counts.
	* Test `get_deployment_status` by verifying the correct status is returned.
	* Test `scale_deployment` by verifying the scale is updated correctly.
	* Test `rollout_update` by verifying the image is updated correctly.
2. Write a test suite for the entire script using pytest.

IV. Documentation

1. Create a README file to describe the project and its purpose.
2. Add comments to the code explaining what each function does and how it's used.
3. Generate API documentation using Sphinx or another tool (optional).

V. Deployment and Testing

1. Deploy the script to a Kubernetes cluster using kubectl.
2. Run the tests using pytest to ensure the script works as expected.

VI. Maintenance and Updates

1. Monitor the script for any issues or errors.
2. Update the script to handle changes in Kubernetes deployments or test cases.
3. Add new testing features as needed.

By following these instructions, you'll create a comprehensive Python script to test Kubernetes deployments, with robust testing and documentation.
