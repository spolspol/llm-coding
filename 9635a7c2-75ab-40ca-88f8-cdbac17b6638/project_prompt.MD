Battleships is a classic turn-based two-player strategy game where players try to sink each other's ships by guessing the location of their opponent's vessels on a 10x10 grid. Each player has a hidden ship layout, and takes turns calling out coordinates to attempt to hit their opponent's vessels. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

The game can be played in either text or graphics mode, with the same rules applying in both cases. In graphics mode, players may use a graphical user interface (GUI) to select and place ships on the grid, as well as see a visual representation of hits and misses during gameplay. The game is typically played on paper using pencil and paper, but can also be played online or via mobile apps.

Objectives:

- Create a text-based Battleships game in python using TK library

Key Features:

- Two player mode
- Hidden ship layout
- Turn-based gameplay
- Ships and grid size can be customized (default 10x10)
- Graphics mode optional

Steps to create a text-based Battleships game in python using TK library:

1. Create a new project directory and save all your files in it.
2. Set up the Tkinter library for GUI elements by importing the needed modules (e.g., tkinter, ttk, etc.).
3. Create a new class that represents the game board and initializes it with the desired dimensions (default 10x10).
4. Use a loop to iterate through the grid and create buttons for each cell, adding event handlers for clicking on a specific cell. You can use the text property of the button to display the ship status in the respective cell (e.g., empty or hit).
5. Create two classes, one for each player, that handle their turn and update the board accordingly.
6. Use a loop to iterate through the grid and create buttons for each player's ships. You can use the text property of the button to display the ship name and its current status (e.g., sunk or unsunk).
7. Create functions for the game logic, such as handling a hit, checking if a ship has been sunk, and determining the winner.
8. Use a loop to iterate through the grid and create buttons for each cell on the board. You can use the text property of the button to display the contents of that cell (e.g., empty or hit).
9. Add event handlers to each button to update the status of the corresponding ship when it is clicked.
10. Create a function to handle the game loop and switch turns between players. The function should check if the game is over, display the winner if necessary, and repeat until the game is over.

You can use this as a starting point for your Battleships game project in python with TK library. You may need to modify or add additional features depending on your specific requirements.
