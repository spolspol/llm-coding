Here is a set of instructions for LLM to build a complete software project to manage Kubernetes deployments and pods:

**Project Requirements:**

1. Create a command-line tool that allows users to manage Kubernetes deployments and pods.
2. The tool should provide options for deploying, deleting, and viewing information about Kubernetes deployments and pods.

**Step 1: Set up the Project Structure**

* Create a new directory for the project and navigate into it.
* Initialize a new Go module using `go mod init`.
* Create the following directories:
	+ `cmd`: contains the main executable file
	+ `pkg`: contains reusable packages
	+ `docs`: contains documentation files

**Step 2: Set up Dependencies**

* Install the required dependencies for the project, including:
	+ `github.com/kubernetes/client-go`
	+ `github.com/spf13/cobra`

**Step 3: Create the Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

* In the `cmd` directory, create a new file called `main.go`.
* Define a new command-line interface using `cobra` and add options for:
	+ Deploying a Kubernetes deployment or pod
	+ Deleting a Kubernetes deployment or pod
	+ Viewing information about a Kubernetes deployment or pod
* Use `cobra` to define the available commands and options.

**Step 4: Implement Deployment Management**

* In the `pkg` directory, create a new file called `deployment.go`.
* Define functions for deploying, deleting, and viewing information about Kubernetes deployments.
* Use the `kubernetes/client-go` package to interact with the Kubernetes API.
* Implement error handling and logging mechanisms.

**Step 5: Implement Pod Management**

* In the `pkg` directory, create a new file called `pod.go`.
* Define functions for deploying, deleting, and viewing information about Kubernetes pods.
* Use the `kubernetes/client-go` package to interact with the Kubernetes API.
* Implement error handling and logging mechanisms.

**Step 6: Integrate CLI and Deployment Management**

* In the `cmd` directory, modify the `main.go` file to integrate the CLI and deployment management functions.
* Use the `cobra` package to handle command-line arguments and options.

**Step 7: Test the Project**

* Write unit tests for the deployment management and pod management functions using Go's built-in testing package.
* Run the tests to ensure the project is functioning correctly.

**Step 8: Document the Project**

* Create a `README.md` file in the root directory of the project, describing its purpose and usage.
* Create a `docs` directory and add documentation files (e.g., Markdown files) for each feature or section of the project.
* Use Go's built-in documentation comments to generate HTML documentation.

**Step 9: Package and Distribute**

* Create a new executable file by running `go build main.go`.
* Package the project using a tool like `upx` or `compress` to reduce its size.
* Distribute the project (e.g., as a binary, or as source code) for others to use.
