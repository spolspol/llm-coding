### Instructions for Building Reddit Clone Data Fetcher and MongoDB Storage

#### 1. Project Setup
   - **Create Project Directory**: Set up a new directory for the project.
   - **Initialize Virtual Environment**: Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

#### 2. Dependency Installation
   - **Install Required Libraries**:
     - Selenium
     - Pymongo
     - Requests
     - Random
     - Time
     - Argparse
     - Json Schema

#### 3. Configuration File
   - **Create JSON Configuration File**: Design a JSON schema for the configuration file (`config.json`) to include:
     - Reddit clone URL
     - Username and password for login
     - MongoDB connection details (URI, database name)
     - Number of requests per header
     - Delay between requests

#### 4. Code Architecture Pattern
   - **Modular Design**: Break down the script into functional components.
     - **Configuration Manager**: Handles loading and parsing configuration files.
     - **WebDriver Manager**: Manages Selenium WebDriver operations.
     - **MongoDB Manager**: Manages MongoDB connections and data storage.
     - **Data Fetcher**: Fetches posts and comments using requests library.
     - **Error Handler**: Handles errors gracefully during the fetching process.

#### 5. Functional Components Specification

##### Configuration Manager
   - **Load Configuration**:
     - Parse command-line arguments to get the configuration file path.
     - Load JSON schema from the provided configuration file.
   - **Validate Configuration**:
     - Validate the loaded configuration against the predefined JSON schema.

##### WebDriver Manager
   - **Initialize WebDriver**:
     - Set up Selenium WebDriver with Chrome options to simulate a Chromebook browser.
   - **Login Process**:
     - Navigate to the Reddit clone login page.
     - Enter username and password, then click the submit button.
     - Wait for successful login (e.g., redirect to homepage).
   - **Close WebDriver**:
     - Close the WebDriver session after operations are complete.

##### MongoDB Manager
   - **Initialize MongoDB Client**:
     - Set up MongoDB client using the connection details from the configuration file.
   - **Create Collections**:
     - Create 'my_posts' and 'my_comments' collections in the specified database.
   - **Store Data**:
     - Store fetched posts and comments in respective MongoDB collections with appropriate metadata.

##### Data Fetcher
   - **Initialize Headers**:
     - Initialize a list of browser headers to simulate different devices (Chromebook, iOS).
   - **Fetch Data**:
     - Fetch posts and comments using the requests library with appropriate headers.
     - Implement delays between requests as specified in the configuration file.

##### Error Handler
   - **Handle Errors Gracefully**:
     - Implement error handling for network issues, login failures, and other potential exceptions.
     - Log errors and continue or terminate based on the severity of the issue.

#### 6. Implementation Steps

1. **Configuration Manager**
   - Parse command-line arguments using `argparse`.
   - Load and validate the configuration file using `json` and `jsonschema`.

2. **WebDriver Manager**
   - Initialize Selenium WebDriver with Chrome options.
   - Implement login process using Selenium commands.
   - Wait for successful login and handle any login failures.

3. **MongoDB Manager**
   - Connect to MongoDB using `pymongo`.
   - Create collections 'my_posts' and 'my_comments'.
   - Store fetched data in the respective collections with metadata.

4. **Data Fetcher**
   - Initialize a list of browser headers.
   - Fetch posts and comments using the requests library with appropriate headers and delays.
   - Handle errors during the fetching process.

5. **Error Handler**
   - Implement try-except blocks to handle network issues, login failures, and other exceptions.
   - Log errors and decide on the course of action based on the error type.

6. **Main Script Execution**
   - Integrate all components into the main script.
   - Ensure proper sequencing of operations: configuration loading, WebDriver initialization, data fetching, MongoDB storage, and cleanup.

#### 7. Testing
   - **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each functional component to ensure they work as expected.
   - **Integration Tests**: Test the entire workflow from configuration loading to data storage in MongoDB.
   - **Error Handling Tests**: Verify that the script handles errors gracefully and logs them appropriately.

#### 8. Deployment
   - **Package Script**: Package the script into an executable format if needed.
   - **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation on how to use the script, including command-line arguments and configuration file details.

By following these instructions, you will be able to build a Python script that fetches posts and comments from a Reddit clone, stores them in MongoDB, and handles various configurations and errors effectively.
