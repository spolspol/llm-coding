### Project Name: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Objective:
To create a simple web-based game of Tic-Tac-Toe (X/O) with both front-end and back-end components.

### Requirements:
1. **Front-End:**
   - Create an HTML page for the game board.
   - Implement JavaScript to handle user interactions (click events on the board).
   - Use CSS for basic styling of the game board and pieces.

2. **Back-End:**
   - Implement a server using Node.js or Python Flask/Django.
   - Handle game logic, including turns, winning conditions, and multiplayer functionality.

3. **Multiplayer:**
   - Allow two players to play against each other in real-time.
   - Ensure that the game state is consistent across both players' views.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Write a README.md file explaining how to set up and run the project.
   - Include screenshots of the game interface.

### Instructions:

#### 1. Project Setup
- Create a new folder for your project and navigate into it using the command line.
- Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` and following the prompts or use `yarn create` if you prefer Yarn.

#### 2. Front-End Development
- **HTML Structure:**
  - Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) with a basic structure.
  - Include placeholders for the game board cells, each represented by a div or span element.
  
  ```html
  <div id="game-board">
    <!-- Cells will be generated dynamically -->
  </div>
  ```

- **CSS Styling:**
  - Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) to style the game board and pieces.
  - Ensure the cells are square and that they can be clicked.

- **JavaScript Logic:**
  - Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) to handle user interactions.
  - Add event listeners to each cell for click events.
  - Implement logic to place X or O on the board based on the current player's turn.
  
  ```javascript
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const cells = document.querySelectorAll('#game-board div');
    // Initialize game state and start listening for clicks
  });
  ```

#### 3. Back-End Development
- **Node.js Server:**
  - Install Express.js using npm (`npm install express`) to create a simple server.
  - Set up basic routing to serve the HTML file and handle POST requests from the front-end.

  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  const port = 3000;

  app.use(express.static('public'));

  app.post('/play', (req, res) => {
    // Handle game logic here
    // Update game state and respond to front-end
  });

  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
  ```

- **Game Logic:**
  - On each POST request from the front-end, update the game state.
  - Check for a winning condition or draw after each move.
  - Respond to the front-end with the updated game state.

#### 4. Multiplayer Implementation
- **Session Management:**
  - Use Express sessions or another session management tool to keep track of which player is whose turn.

- **Real-Time Communication:**
  - Implement WebSockets using a library like Socket.IO to enable real-time communication between clients.
  - Broadcast updates to both players when a move is made.

#### 5. Documentation
- **README.md:**
  - Write a README file that includes:
    - Project setup instructions (Node.js, Express, etc.)
    - Instructions on running the server (`npm start`)
    - How to play the game
    - Any additional features or customizations

- **Screenshots:**
  - Capture screenshots of your game interface and include them in a folder named `docs`.
  - Reference these images in your README for visual guidance.

### Final Steps:
- Test the game thoroughly, ensuring all functionalities work as expected.
- Deploy your server and make it accessible online if needed.
- Share your project on GitHub with a link to the deployed version for others to test.

Good luck with your Tic-Tac-Toe game project!
